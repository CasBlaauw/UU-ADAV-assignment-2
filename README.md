# Hand-in assignment 2 for the course Applied Data Analysis and Visualisation.
Written together with Dominic and Netanja.

## Description:
In this assignment, you will design and build an RShiny Application. With its purpose being to visualize and provide analytical output for one of the selected datasets, using appropriate visualization and analysis methods covered in this course. The RShiny Application should be a stand alone application. That is, the user should be able to understand itâ€™s purpose and outcomes from just the application (so without requiring any additional explanation outside of the application). 
For this assignment, you will use one of the six datasets provided, each of which are outlined in brief below. Each of these datasets has a large number of variables, and it is up to you which variables you will use/not use within your visualization and analysis process.
